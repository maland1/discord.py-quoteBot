# discordBot
This bot is primarily written using the discord.py library.

This repo contains all of the code necessary for the functionality of the discord bot, as well as some misc. other functions such as updating the bot remotely or restarting the Pi it is hosted on.

The only things not included in this repo are the "quotes.json", "lastQuote.json" and the ".env" file which contain quotes and the discord bot token respectively.
