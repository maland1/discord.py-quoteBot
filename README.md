# Malenia Bot
This bot is written in Golang along with a number of libraries written by other users (discordgo, gocron and go-sqlite3).

This repo contains all of the code necessary for the functionality of the discord bot, as well as some misc. other functions such as updating the bot remotely or restarting the Pi it is hosted on.
